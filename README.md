# Personal CV Page

This project contains a simple React site built with **Vite** that showcases Chris Chow's CV. The site is designed with a tech-inspired theme and can be hosted directly on GitHub Pages.

## Development

Install dependencies and start a dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

Create a production build (output in `dist/`):

```bash
npm run build
```

You can then deploy the contents of `dist/` to GitHub Pages.
